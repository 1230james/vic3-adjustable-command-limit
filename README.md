# Adjustable Command Limits

For Victoria 3

## Overview

**Adjustable Command Limits** (ACL) is a mod for [Victoria 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/) which adds, as the name suggests, adjustable command limits for all commanders in the game.

Standard Victoria 3 gameplay involves generals and admirals who have a set quantity of battalions or flotillas under their control based on their military rank and select character traits. The only thing the player has direct control over is the rank of their commanders and in only one direction: upwards. The player can only raise the command limit of their commanders, never lower them.

This poses an issue for strategy. There are times were the player may want to keep the size of a single general's brigade down. Most notably, the need to match the size of one's brigade with a navy task force in order to efficiently conduct naval invasions. With both navy acquisitions being very slow and generals being promoted during events, it can be very annoying when the player needs to conduct naval invasions, but their armies are simply too large for their navy to support. There may be other situations where the player would prefer mobilizing fewer troops in certain areas, as well.

ACL aims to solve that by adding buttons on the commander information screens allowing players to adjust the size of one commander's forces dynamically regardless of rank or character traits, allowing for greater strategic flexibility and alleviating some annoyances experienced in the base game.
